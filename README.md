# Data Science Entry Test – Python Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for the Data Science Entry Test. The objective of this assessment is to evaluate problem-solving ability, logical thinking, and programming skills using Python.

All tasks were completed with a structured and analytical approach, focusing on accuracy, input validation, readability, and real-world applicability.

## Repository Structure
The solutions are organised into individual Jupyter Notebooks:

- **Q1:** Swap values with input validation  
- **Q2:** Find and replace elements in a list  
- **Q3:** Update and manage dictionary values  
- **Q4:** Reverse a string with validation  
- **Q5:** Check numerical divisibility  
- **Q6:** Identify the first negative number in a list  
- **Q7:** Object-oriented programming using a Car class  

Each notebook contains:
- Clear function design
- Step-by-step logic
- Validation and error handling
- Example test scenarios
- Output verification

## Key Skills Demonstrated
This test highlights the following technical competencies:

- Python programming fundamentals  
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, strings)  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Logical and structured problem solving  
- Clean and readable code  
- Object-oriented programming concepts

## Approach and Methodology
For each task, I followed a systematic workflow:

### 1. Problem Understanding  
Carefully analysed the requirements and clarified expected outputs.

### 2. Solution Design  
Designed logical and efficient functions with clear structure.

### 3. Implementation  
Developed clean, well-commented, and readable Python code.

### 4. Validation  
Included checks for:
- Data type correctness
- Edge cases
- Error handling (e.g., non-numeric input, invalid formats)

### 5. Testing  
Each solution was tested using multiple scenarios to ensure correctness and reliability.
